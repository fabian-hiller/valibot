### Best practices

As we strive for excellence in our codebase, here are some guidelines to make your contributions shine:

- Code in TypeScript: Embrace the power of TypeScript for writing your code. It helps in maintaining consistency and leveraging TypeScript's robust features.
- Clarity and cleanliness: Write code that speaks for itself. Aim for simplicity and clarity, making it easy for others to read and understand at a glance.
- Commenting and documentation: Illuminate your code with clear comments. Explain the purpose and functionality of your code. Where applicable, include links to relevant Wiki articles or external sources for further context.
- Illustrative examples: Enhance understanding by providing minimal yet meaningful examples to demonstrate the expected output of your code.
- Include test cases: Show the robustness of your code by accompanying it with well-thought-out test cases. This practice not only validates your code but also assists in maintaining the code quality in the long run.
- Size matters for PRs: Keep your pull requests concise and focused. Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge, speeding up the development process. This approach helps in isolating changes and simplifying troubleshooting.
- Crafting a good commit message: Your commit messages are a roadmap of your changes. Make them informative and useful for everyone.
