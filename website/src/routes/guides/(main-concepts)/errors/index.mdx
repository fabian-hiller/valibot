# Errors

For error handling I use internally with <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> my own error class, which supports you in case of an issue, with extensive information.

## Issues

When validating unknown data against a schema, I collect information about the existing issues and at the end, if there is at least one issue, I throw a single <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> that contains all issues. Therefore, each instance of a <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> always contains at least one Issue.

### Overview

You can access the issues of a <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> via `.issues`. The issues are an array of objects. In the following I will explain you exactly what information an issue contains and how this information can help you.

```ts
type Issue = {
  // Required info
  reason: IssueReason;
  validation: string;
  origin: 'key' | 'value';
  message: string;
  input: any;

  // Optional info
  path?: PathItem[];
  issues?: Issues;
  abortEarly?: boolean;
  abortPipeEarly?: boolean;
};
```

### Required info

Each issue contains the following required information.

#### Reason

`reason` describes the reason of the problem. If an input does not match the data type, for example a number was passed instead of a string, `reason` has the value `'type'`. In all other cases the reason is not the datatype but the actual content of the data. For example, if a string is invalid because it does not match a regex, `reason` has the value `'string'`.

#### Validation

`validation` describes which function did the validation. If the schema function `array` detects that the input is not an array, `validation` has the value `'array'`. If the `minLength` validation function detects that an array is too short, `validation` has the value `'min_length'`.

#### Origin

`origin` describes the source of the issue and, except for an issue on a key of a map or record, always has the value `'value'`.

#### Message

`message` contains a human-understandable error message that can be fully customized by you, as described <Link href="/guides/schemas/#error-messages">here</Link>.

#### Input

`input` contains the specific data where the issue was found. For complex data, for example objects, `input` contains the value of the respective key that does not match the schema.

### Optional info

Some issue contain further optional information.

#### Path

`path` is an array of objects that describes where an issue is located within complex data. Each path item contains the following information.

```ts
type PathItem = {
  schema: string;
  input: any;
  key: string | number | symbol;
  value: any;
};
```

For example, you can use the following code to create a dot path.

```ts
const dotPath = issue.path.map((item) => item.key).join('.');
```

#### Issues

`issues` currently only occurs when using <Link href="/api/union">`union`</Link> or <Link href="/api/unionAsync">`unionAsync`</Link> and contains all issues of the schemas of an union type.

#### Abort

`abortEarly` and `abortPipeEarly` gives you an info that the validation was aborted prematurely. You can find more info about this in the <Link href="/guides/parse-data/#abort-early">parse data</Link> guide.

## Formatting

For common use cases like forms, I help you with small functions to format the issues of an <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link>. However, once you understand how my errors work, you can easily format them yourself and put them in the right form for your use case.

### Flatten errors

If you are only interested in the error messages to show them to your users, you can convert a <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> to a flat object with <Link href="/api/flatten">`flatten`</Link>. Below is an example.

```ts
import { flatten, object, parse, string } from 'valibot'; // 0.7 kB

const ObjectSchema = object({
  key: string('Value of "key" is missing.'),
  nested: object({
    key: string('Value of "nested.key" is missing.'),
  }),
});

try {
  parse(ObjectSchema, { nested: {} }); // Throws an error
} catch (error) {
  console.log(flatten(error));
}
```

The <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> thrown in the code sample above this text contains the following issues.

```ts
[
  {
    reason: 'type',
    validation: 'string',
    origin: 'value',
    message: 'Value of "key" is missing.',
    input: undefined,
    path: [
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: { nested: {} },
        key: 'key',
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    reason: 'type',
    validation: 'string',
    origin: 'value',
    message: 'Value of "nested.key" is missing.',
    input: undefined,
    path: [
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: { nested: {} },
        key: 'nested',
        value: {},
      },
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: {},
        key: 'key',
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

However, with the help of <Link href="/api/flatten">`flatten`</Link> the <Link href="/api/ValiError">`ValiError`</Link> was converted to the following object.

```ts
{
  nested: {
    key: ['Value of "key" is missing.'],
    'nested.key': ['Value of "nested.key" is missing.']
  }
}
```
