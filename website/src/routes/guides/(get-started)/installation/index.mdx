# Installation

I am currently available for Node, Bun and Deno. Below I will show you how to add me to your project.

## General

It should make no difference whether you use individual imports or a wildcard import. Tree shaking and code splitting should work in both cases.

If you are using TypeScript, I recommend that you enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` so that all types are calculated correctly.

> The minimum required TypeScript version is v5.0.2.

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
    // ...
  }
}
```

## From npm

For Node and Bun, you can add me to your project with a single command via your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install valibot     # npm
yarn add valibot        # yarn
pnpm add valibot        # pnpm
bun add valibot         # bun
```

After that you can import me into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'valibot';
```

## From Deno

With Deno, you can reference me directly through my deno.land/x URL.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';
```

> The rest of this documentation assumes that you are using npm for the import statements in the code examples.
