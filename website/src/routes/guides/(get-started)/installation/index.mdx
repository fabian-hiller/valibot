# Installation

I am currently available for Node, Bun and Deno. Below I will show you how to add me to your project.

## General

Except for this guide, the rest of this documentation assumes that you are using npm for the import statements in the code examples.

It should make no difference whether you use individual imports or a wildcard import. Tree shaking and code splitting should work in both cases.

If you are using TypeScript, I recommend that you enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` so that all types are calculated correctly and skip library checks.

> The minimum required TypeScript version is v5.0.2.

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    // ...
  }
}
```

## From npm

For Node and Bun, you can add me to your project with a single command via your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install valibot     # npm
yarn add valibot        # yarn
pnpm add valibot        # pnpm
bun add valibot         # bun
```

After that you can import me into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'valibot';
```

## From JSR

For Node, Deno and Bun, you can add me to your project with a single command via your favorite package manager.

```bash
deno add @valibot/valibot          # deno
npx jsr add @valibot/valibot       # npm
yarn dlx jsr add @valibot/valibot  # yarn
pnpm dlx jsr add @valibot/valibot  # pnpm
bunx jsr add @valibot/valibot      # bun
```

After that you can import me into any JavaScript or TypeScript file.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from '@valibot/valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from '@valibot/valibot';
```

In Deno, you can also directly reference me using `jsr:` specifiers.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'jsr:@valibot/valibot';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'jsr:@valibot/valibot';
```

## From Deno

With Deno, you can reference me directly through my deno.land/x URL.

```ts
// With individual imports
import { … } from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';

// With a wildcard import
import * as v from 'https://deno.land/x/valibot/mod.ts';
```
