# Objects

To validate objects with a schema, you can use <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> or <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link>. You use <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> for an object with a specific shape and <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link> for objects with any number of uniform entries.

## Object schema

The first argument is used to define the specific structure of the object. Each entry consists of a key and a schema as the value. The entries are then validated against the key and schema.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const ObjectSchema = v.object({
  key1: v.string(),
  key2: v.number(),
});
```

### Rest argument

By default, <Link href="/api/object/">`object`</Link> ignores and removes unknown entries. This means that entries that you have not defined in the first argument will not be validated and will not be added to the output. You can control this behavior with the `rest` argument.

By using <Link href="/api/never/">`never`</Link> for the `rest` argument, you can make the validation strict and forbid unknown entries completely. If unknown entries are detected, an issue is returned for each entry.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const ObjectSchema = v.object(
  {
    key1: v.string(),
    key2: v.number(),
  },
  v.never()
);
```

Alternatively, you can also allow unknown entries with <Link href="/api/unknown/">`unknown`</Link> and add them to the output. Instead of <Link href="/api/unknown/">`unknown`</Link>, you can also use any other schema function, such as <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>, for a typed output.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const ObjectSchema = v.object(
  {
    key1: v.string(),
    key2: v.number(),
  },
  v.unknown()
);
```

### Pipeline validation

To validate the value of an entry based on another entry, you can use <Link href="/api/custom/">`custom`</Link> in the object's pipeline. You can also use <Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> to assign the issue to a specific object key in the event of an error.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const CalculationSchema = v.object(
  {
    a: v.number(),
    b: v.number(),
    sum: v.number(),
  },
  [
    v.forward(
      v.custom(
        ({ a, b, sum }) => a + b === sum,
        'The calculation is incorrect.'
      ),
      ['sum']
    ),
  ]
);
```

## Record schema

For an object with any number of uniform entries, <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link> is the right choice. If you pass only one schema as an argument to the function, this will be used to validate the values of the record. In this case, the keys are automatically validated with <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const RecordSchema = v.record(v.number()); // Record<string, number>
```

### Key argument

To explicitly define the schema of the keys, you can pass two schemas to <Link href="/api/record/">`record`</Link>. The first schema will be used for the keys and the second schema for the values.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const RecordSchema = v.record(v.string(), v.number()); // Record<string, number>
```

Instead of <Link href="/api/string/">`string`</Link>, you can also use <Link href="/api/enum_/">`enum_`</Link>, <Link href="/api/picklist/">`picklist`</Link>, <Link href="/api/special/">`special`</Link> or <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> to validate the keys.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const RecordSchema = v.record(v.picklist(['key1', 'key2']), v.number()); // { key1?: number; key2?: number }
```

### Pipeline validation

To validate the value of an entry based on another entry, you can use <Link href="/api/custom/">`custom`</Link> in the records's pipeline. You can also use <Link href="/api/forward/">`forward`</Link> to assign the issue to a specific record key in the event of an error.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const CalculationSchema = v.record(v.picklist(['a', 'b', 'sum']), v.number(), [
  v.forward(
    v.custom(
      ({ a, b, sum }) => (a || 0) + (b || 0) === (sum || 0),
      'The calculation is incorrect.'
    ),
    ['sum']
  ),
]);
```
